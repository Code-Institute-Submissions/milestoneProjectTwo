# Ken Cormican - Milestone Project Two 

This is my Second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Development.

--------

## The Project Brief
--------
The brief was to create an Interactive Web Front End that exposes the learnings from the HTML, CSS, JS, UXD & Interactive Front End Development Modules. 

1. Design, develop and implement a dynamic front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
2. Implement front-end interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
3. Test an interactive front-end web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages
4. Deploy an interactive front-end web application to a Cloud platform
5. Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such
--------

### Development Process

* Design a web application following the principles of UX design which meets accessibility guidelines, is easy to navigate and allows the user to find information and resources intuitively
* Design a web application that lets the user initiate and control actions, and gives feedback
* Implement a web application whose purpose is immediately evident to a new user and which provides a good solution to the userâ€™s demands and expectations
* Write code such that users who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page without having to use browser navigation buttons
* Commit often, for each individual feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small, well-defined and have clear, descriptive messages
* Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, demonstrating that it has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of, and user stories for a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences).
* Document the UX design work undertaken for this project, including any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc created as part of the design process, and the reasoning behind it.
  Include diagrams created as part of the design process and demonstrate that these have been followed through to implementation
* Document testing fully to include evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
* Fully document the deployment procedure in a section in the README file.

## Purpose

I've chosen to develop my own Website to produce an Irish COVID 19 Statistics Dashboard integrating functionality from the Google MAPs API with historical COVID statistics.
I intend on using an OpenSource Government produced Data Set to provide a hypothetical end user with accurate and localised COVID information.

--------
## UX

### Requirements

Use the Google API too render a COVID 19 Heat Map of Ireland broken down by County Boundary.
The Map should be responsive allowing end user to request more detailed statistics by selecting the county on the MAP.
I addition to the heat map, A Government data set should be used to provide an accurate breakdown of infection and death rate :
    * per county
    * per gender
    * per age range
The End user should also be able to select a specific date range and the website should produce graphs or pie charts refeling statistics.

### User stories:

* I would like to have localised figures showing the number of infected people and the number of deaths for each county .

* I would like to see how the disease is affecting different age groups.

*  Are children vectors?

*  What is the percentage breakdown of Men vs Women?

*  What was the peak and when did it occur?

*  How does that compare to now?
